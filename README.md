Quest 3 Godot AR Project that allows you to place blocks in your space and then export what you build as an STL for 3D printing

A/X button spawns in cubes.

B/Y button changes the cube colors.

The grab button grabs the cubes.

And the trigger button saves the cubes that have been placed in the voxel grid to downloads.

I have found that the best way to get the stl files to your computer is to just turn on developer mode on your quest and connect it with USB to your computer. 

The scaling is very funky right now, so you will likely have to do some manual scaling in the slicer.

Very open to issues, feature requests, and any ideas. This is MIT licensed, so take my idea and run with it if you want to do something cool.

Some ideas I have had is a 3D puzzle game, a color by numbers game, and a speed build game.
